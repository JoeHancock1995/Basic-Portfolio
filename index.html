            <p>Born in Wakefield, England (near Leeds in Yorkshire) I relocated with my father
                to Houston, Texas in 2002 at the age of 7. I've grown quite fond of Houston over the years 
                and find it to be a very under appreciated city, though its weather is quite unbearable
                at times. After spending roughly 11 years in Houston, in 2013 I moved to Austin, Texas at age 18. 
                The intention was to play music and make art, but quite honestly I had to plan on how
                I would accomplish that considering I had never been to the city nor even seen
                so much as picture of its skyline. I eventually was in a band that toured and did quite well
                but eventually came to its conclusion, which in turn allowed me to 
                embark on my own personal music. Along with music I also share a passion 
                for literature and history and have had two brief biographies published
                by the Texas State Historical (TSHA). The first was about George Ballas who invented the weed wacker and also 
                resided in Houston, Texas. The second was about William (Billy) Thompson from England
                who eventually became a (in)famous gambler and gunslinger in Texas. Both can be foud online in the 'Handbook of Texas' 
                of the TSHA website.</p>
