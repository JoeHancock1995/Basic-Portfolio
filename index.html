            <p>Born in England, I moved to Houston in 2002 at age 7. Athough its weather is quite unbearable I've always been fond of
                Houston. After spending roughly 11 years in Houston I moved to Austin in 2013.
                I have had two brief biographies published by the Texas State Historical (TSHA). The first was about George Ballas 
                who invented the weed wacker and also resided in Houston, Texas. The second was about William (Billy) Thompson from England
                who eventually became a (in)famous gambler and gunslinger in Texas. Both can be foud online in the 'Handbook of Texas' 
                of the TSHA website.</p>
