          <p>My Name is Joe Hancock and I was born in Wakefield, England. I've lived in Texas since 2002.
             I enjoy playing synthesizer the most, but I do like to noodle with other instruments 
             in my spare time or take them apart and rebuild them.I attempt to make visual companion
             pieces to my songs and I hope some web development skills will allow me to experiment with
            a different medium that i've always been interested in.
